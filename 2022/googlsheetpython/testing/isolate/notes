There are some simple techniques you can use to test parts of your application that have many side effects:

Refactoring code to follow the Single Responsibility Principle
Mocking out any method or function calls to remove side effects
Using integration testing instead of unit testing for this piece of the application

If youâ€™re not familiar with mocking, see Python CLI Testingpdf in folderfor some great examples.
